Ive been working on this for the past few days and have gotten the assignment done. I am only having trouble with lauching the webpage to go live. Whenever I commit and push my changes to my remote repository and launch the site, the only thing that appears in the window is the ReadME. I don't know if you can view my Github but all the files are there and refactored. This Readme is just blank as it was not saved from the multiple attempts and Repositories made to try to lauch the site. Thank you.
